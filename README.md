# CartPole-v0-DDQN

Here are two attempts at solving the CartPole Environment from Open AI Gym. Both of these are Double Deep Q Networks implemented using the Keras API from TensorFlow 2.x.

## Version 1

- 1500+ episodes of training.
- Q Learning 
- Epsilon Greedy Policy (with epsilon decay)
- Average Reward: 150

## Version 2

- 500 episodes of training
- Expected Sarsa 
- Softmax Policy (with temperature decay)
- Average Reward: 180
